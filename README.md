## Instructions
Every game has its own shuffled deck. There are 16 cards, which have to be matched in 8 pairs. The goal is to match all the cards. Start the game by clicking on any card. That will start the timer and moves counter. There is also a star rating. You can get 3 stars for 15 moves or less, 2 stars for 24 moves or less and 1 star if there was more moves than 24.
When you finish your game, there will pop up a message with amount of moves, your time and star rating. Then you can choose if you want to play again. 

You can always restart your game with the restart button in score panel. It restarts times, moves counter and gives you a new deck of card.

Good luck!!
